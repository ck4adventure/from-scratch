# From Scratch

As a hobbyist baker and coder, I want to have my own dedicated website to store my favorite recipes and get to them easily. As a baker, I want to be able to search my recipes by keyword, and filter them by included or excluded ingredients, category, etc. As a coder, I want to eventually be able to analyze my recipes by their ingredients and find possible duplicates by ingredient combination and quantity variance.
